Mentor: Priyabrata Bag

Project Overview – Brief description of your project goals
The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a hybrid Quantum Neural Network–Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QNN-QRL) protocol based on algorithms described in the referenced research. The objective is to build a working simulation framework using Qiskit that can (1) train parameterized quantum circuits for bit-level decoding, (2) implement a reinforcement-style interval-shrinking estimation procedure, and (3) evaluate the model under both noiseless and noisy quantum channels, including bit-flip, phase-flip, depolarizing, amplitude damping, and phase damping errors.The overall target is to produce a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the QNN-QRL algorithms.
